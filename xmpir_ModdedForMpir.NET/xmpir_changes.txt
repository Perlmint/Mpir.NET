Changes to X-MPIR
=================

Uses one single dynamic mpir loader for both Windows and Linux, so there's
no longer the need for need for the separate dl4windows.dll and dl4linux.dll
loaders. 


Changes to xmpir4cs.inc
-----------------------

Moved mpz_t, mpq_t, mpf_t and gmp_randstate_t into separate files.

Rewrote the mpz_t etc structs into classes that disposes the unmanaged resources, 
and added the mpz_intptr etc types needed to support them.

mp_constructor logic was changed to allow for mpz_intptr, mpq_intptr etc.

Put the mpir class in a namespace. New versions of LoadLibrarySafe and 
GetProcAddressSafe, which eliminate the need for dl4windows.dll and dl4linux.dll. 

Made the mpir class partial and moved most of the non generated part of it to a 
separate file, mpir.cs.

Added [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)] to delegate declaration generation
and memory management functions, to avoid pInvokeStackImbalance.
"The pInvokeStackImbalance MDA is implemented only for 32-bit x86 platforms."

Added import and export functions for binary data.



Changes to xmpir.inc
--------------------
Added functions:
DLLEXPORT void UxMpir_internal_mpz_import(mpz_t rop, size_t count, int order, size_t size, int endian, size_t nails, const void *op) 
DLLEXPORT void *UxMpir_internal_mpz_export(void *rop, size_t *countp, int order, size_t size, int endian, size_t nails, mpz_t op) 


build-win.bat
-------------
New file that builds both 32- and 64-bit DLLs, and restores the search path after build. 

gen-and-build-win.bat 
---------------------
New file that's a centralized place for setting build paths. Runs the generator and calls build-win.bat. 

xmpir-for-csharp.bat
--------------------
Removed the no longer needed building of dl4windows.dll and dl4linux.dll.
