=== X-MPIR - C# wrapper for MPIR =====================================

This directory contains development version of X-MPIR - C# wrapper for
MPIR.

X-MPIR has following essential features:
* it provides same interface for 32- and 64-bit systems
* it works under Windows and Linux
*  C#  applications  developed  for  MS  Windows may be copied between
32-bit  and  64-bit  systems  without  recompilation (in binary form).
Wrapper automatically selects DLL with suitable ABI.
*  Linux  applications may NOT be copied without recompilation between
different  systems because different Linux distributions aren't binary
compatible.  However,  only  native  MPIR  DLLs  have to be recompiled
during installation.


=== COMPILING UNDER WINDOWS ==========================================

X-MPIR  is  shipped  with  precompiled "generic C" libraries which are
slow  but  portable. If you want to compile CPU-aware version of MPIR,
you have to build yourself 32-bit and 64-bit static libraries and copy
them to mpir-precompiled/win32 and mpir-precompiled/win64 directories.
If  you  are  satisfied with "generic C" build, you just have to go to
(1).

1.  edit  build-win-32.bat  and build-win-64.bat. Make sure that these
files  contain  correct  paths to vcvars32.bat and vcvarsx86_amd64.bat
(MSVC-specific   files  which  prepare  environment  for  command-line
compilation).  Usually  they reside in the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin".

2. execute build-win-32.bat if you want to use X-MPIR under Win32.
   execute build-win-64.bat if you want to use X-MPIR under Win64.
   These batch files generate X-MPIR native DLLs. You can call both if
   you  want  your  application  to  work under both 32-bit and 64-bit
   Windows systems.
   Now you have xmpir32.dll and/or xmpir64.dll in the ./wrapper dir.

3. execute xmpir-for-csharp.bat to prepare C#-specific files

4. now you have:
   * ./wrapper/xmpir.cs  - C# interface for MPIR. Include it into your
   project.  This  file  is  platform-agnostic,  i.e.  it  can be used
   without changes under Windows and Linux.
   *  ./wrapper/xmpir32.dll,  ./wrapper/xmpir64.dll  - native DLLs for
   32/64   Windows   systems.   These   DLLs   must  be  placed in the
   application's executable directory.
   * ./wrapper/dl4windows.dll, ./wrapper/dl4linux.dll   -  C#-specific
   assemblies,   must   be  placed  in  the  application's  executable
   directory. These files are platform-agnostic.



=== COMPILING UNDER LINUX ============================================

Under  Linux  we can't guarantee binary compatibility across different
distributions,  so  we can't distribute precompiled binaries for MPIR.
You have to build and install MPIR as shared library before proceeding
to X-MPIR compilation. 

0. set "+x" permissions for ./build-linux and ./xmpir-for-csharp

1. execute ./build-linux "-Wl,-R,PATH_TO_MPIR".
   Here   PATH_TO_MPIR  is  path  to  directory  where  MPIR's  shared
   libraries are located ("/usr/lib" or "usr/local/lib").

2. execute ./xmpir-for-csharp to prepare C#-specific files

3. now you have:
   * ./wrapper/xmpir.cs  - C# interface for MPIR. Include it into your
   project.  This  file  is  platform-agnostic,  i.e.  it  can be used
   without changes under Windows and Linux.
   *  ./wrapper/xmpir.so - small wrapper around MPIR shared libraries.
   This  file is platform-dependend, it should be built every time you
   use  X-MPIR on a new system. It must be placed in the application's
   executable directory.
   * ./wrapper/dl4windows.dll, ./wrapper/dl4linux.dll   -  C#-specific
   assemblies,   must   be  placed  in  the  application's  executable
   directory. These files are platform-agnostic.


=== USING ============================================================

Well,  interface  mimics  that  of  MPIR  as closely as possible. Only
several  input/output  related  functions  were  omitted. You can find
demos in the ./demos directory.

P.S. Never forget to include xmpir.cs into your project!
